first alternative, use one vcf file to get the header, and the concatenante all the other vcf without the header (this was your error)

grep '^#' chr1.vcf > merge.vcf
grep -v '^#' chr1.vcf  chr2.vcf chr3.vcf chr4.vcf   >> merge.vcf

EDIT

this literally dumps chr1, chr2 into the chrom column.
in my case it was filled with filenames such as HN51_Tumor.flt.vcf:chr1.

So I had to place the header of one file first ..

grep '^#' HN51_Tumor.flt.vcf > Tumor.vcf

Then add (one by one) the contents below the header to the file. 

grep -v '^#' HN51_Tumor.flt.vcf >> Tumor.vcf
grep -v '^#' HN60_Tumor.flt.vcf >> Tumor.vcf
grep -v '^#' HN72_Tumor.flt.vcf >> Tumor.vcf
